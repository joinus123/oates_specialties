             <p>Purchasing and giving a Gift Certificate at Oates Specialties is a simple two-step process:</p>
             <p>Select the Gift Certificate in the desired amount and quantity, fill out the recipient, place in the order cart, and proceed to check-out to finalize the purchase.</p>
             <p>After your purchase is completed, within 24 hours the recipient will receive an email with a gift code and information on the balance. The code may be redeemed for "Store Credit," or used as an additional payment method during checkout on the site.
                Store credits and gift certificates have no expiration date and no fees, and may be used in full or in part. If used in part, the balance will remain in your account’s store credit or on the gift card, and will be available for use on a future purchase.

             <p>Gift Certificate codes may be redeemed in two ways:</p>
             <ul>
                <li>
                   <p><span>Redeem for Store Credit:</span>If you do not already have an account with Oates Specialties, you must create one. Then, go to the Gift Certificate Account Page located in your customer account. Enter the gift code and click 'Redeem'. Available store credit may be viewed on the My Store Credit Page located in your customer account. This is the recommended method.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                   <p><span>Use on a Purchase:</span>To use a Gift Certificate on a purchase directly, go to the Cart Page after selecting your items. Add your gift code to the Gift Certificate input to use it as a payment option.</p>
                </li>
             </ul>
             <p>It is highly recommended that you use the first method to redeem your gift card. By turning it into store credit, you are able to keep up with it easier, and will not have to input the gift card each time you use it on a purchase. Please understand that if you choose to not redeem your gift card via this method, and you lose your gift card, you will not be able to get your code back. By turning your gift card into store credit, it will always be there in your account; you can't lose it, only use it.</p>
             <p>Store credits and gift certificates have no expiration date and no fees, and may be used in full or in part. If used in part, the balance will remain in your account’s store credit or on the gift card, and will be available for use on a future purchase.</p>
